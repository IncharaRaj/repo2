With a new job at a new place, I decided to also try a new laptop running a new platform - Mac OS.
I always used Windows before that. I have used Linux as a VM and on servers I worked on, but as a primary OS -
I sticked with Windows (with no particular reason).  After many recommendations, I decided to give Mac its big break.
As one big advantage of Mac over Windows - I could build my own Android ROM 
(Android operation system software, running on a device), 
which iâ€™ve wanted to try and do for a long time.
